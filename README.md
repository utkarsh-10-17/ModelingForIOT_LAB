## 📌 About

The objective of this course and repository is to:
- Understand the physical design and modeling of IoT systems
- Create accurate 2D/3D representations of sensors, devices, and network layouts
- Visualize how IoT components are arranged and interact in real-world environments

All models and diagrams were created in **AutoCAD**, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and relevance to IoT applications.
